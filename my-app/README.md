This Project is made with react and typescript. Although, in most places, you won't see a lot of types because I let the library do the heavy lifting here but you can never be too safe and anything is better than dealing with undefined and unknown types.

To run the project: `npm start`
To build: `npm run build`

The project is deployed on netlify. So, in order to publish run: `netlify deploy --prod`. When prompted for directory, give `./build`
